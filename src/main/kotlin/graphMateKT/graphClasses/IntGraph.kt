package graphMateKT.graphClasses

/** A graph data structure specialized for integer nodes ranging from 0 to size-1.
 *
 * The IntGraph class behaves a lot like the Graph class when used with integers like the example above.
 * However, * it's more performant, because it does not need to maintain an internal mapping between the nodes and their
 * indexes in the adjacency list. The obvious drawback being it only supports integer nodes.
 *
 * <i>Example usage:</i>
 *
 * ```
 * val intGraph = IntGraph(3) // Creates a graph with nodes 0, 1 and 2
 * graph.addEdge(0, 1, 5.0)
 * graph.addEdge(0, 2, 2.0)
 * graph.addEdge(2, 1, 1.0)
 * graph.dijkstra(0, 1)
 * // NOTE: visualizeGraph() requires the smartgraph.css and smartgraph.properties files to be added to the root of your project.
 * graph.visualizeGraph() // Find the needed files here: https://github.com/Norskeaksel/GraphMateKT
 * ```
 *
 * @param size The number of nodes in the graph. Nodes are represented as integers from 0 to size-1. This cannot be altered later
 * @param isWeighted Indicates whether the graph uses weighted or unweighted edges. */
